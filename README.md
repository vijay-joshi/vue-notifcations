# vue-websocket-notifications

Ask for user consent to display desktop notifications, connect to a websocket server and display desktop notification in a vuejs app.

## Demo:

https://vue-websocket-notifications.vercel.app/


## Introduction

This is a sample application which demonstrates the use of Web Notifications API and Web Sockets API in a vue js app.


Once you start the app, browser will display a box asking you to Allow or Deny displaying desktop notifications. You can allow or deny it. User's consent is stored in a module in the vuex store which can be used to check the consent state application wide.

After that it will connect to a web socket server using browser's inbuilt [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) object.

I have used the websocket echo server so that you can test it locally. You can try sending a test  message by clicking the Test Notification button. A test message is sent to the echo server which then returns it. It is captured by our websocket onmessage listener from where we display the notification. 

[NotifyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notifyjs) has been used to display the notifications.
